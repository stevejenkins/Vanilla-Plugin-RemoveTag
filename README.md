Vanilla-Plugin-RemoveTag
========================

A plugin for Vanilla Forums 2.1.x software that allows desginated individual users to remove specific tags from discussions.

This plugin is useful in cases where you wish to allow any forum member to add a tag (such as xyztechsupport) to a discussion that would indicate that the discussion requires the attention of a designated individual (such as tech support representative). 
The designated individual can view all such tagged posts in one place (using the standard tag display function) and remove the tag from a discussion when the issue is resolved. This plugin makes tag removal possible without needing to provide any additional elevated privileges to the desginated individual.

The plugin can support as many designated individuals and tags as needed.
